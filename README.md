# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. This game allows you to play against the computer for a total of three rounds.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script (`rock_paper_scissors.py`) to start the game.

2. The game will prompt you to enter your choice among "rock," "paper," or "scissors."

3. The computer will randomly select its choice.

4. The winner of each round is determined based on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
   - If both the computer and the player choose the same option, the round is a tie.

5. The game keeps track of the scores for both the computer and the player over three rounds.

6. After three rounds, the game displays the final scores and declares the overall winner as:
   - "Computer Wins" if the computer has a higher score.
   - "Human Wins" if the player has a higher score.
   - "Tie" if the scores are equal.

7. The game then concludes.
